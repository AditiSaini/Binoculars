# Binoculars: Zero-Shot Detection of LLM-Generated Text

We introduce Binoculars, a state-of-the-art method for detecting AI-generated text. Binoculars is a
zero-shot and domain-agnostic (requires no training data) method. It is based on a simple idea: most
decoder-only, causal language models are trained on highly similar data like Common Craw, The Pile, etc. More details
about the results can be found in our paper titled [Spotting LLMs with Binoculars: Zero-Shot Detection of
Machine-Generated Text](insert-link-here).
